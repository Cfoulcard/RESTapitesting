#Star Verse â˜„

Star verse is an open source star gazing Android application equipping you with the power to view pictures of the universe ðŸŒŒ The ability to view these images is gifted by NASA's API and (soon to be) Astrobin's API. 

## Technologies in Use

- Kotlin
- Material Design
- Fragments
- Navigation Graphs
- Volley (For RESTful API)
- JSON
- Glide (For displaying images through JSON)
- [Curved Bottom Navigation Library](https://github.com/susonthapa/curved-bottom-navigation) by Susanthapa
- ViewBinding

## State of the App

**ðŸ› This app is currently a work in progressðŸ› ** A future release will be planned on the Google Play Store!

## Contributing

Because this is an open source project, anyone familiar with the technologies used to build Android Apps is allowed. There are a couple of features that are to be developed in the app, and here as well as within the app will be a list of contributors who helped build the finished product! 

To contribute, please view the contributing guidelines (yet to be made). It is important to note that the API Key used to parse pictures and other information will not be provided by me, but you can follow this [NASA API Generator Link](https://api.nasa.gov/) and this [Astrobin API](https://welcome.astrobin.com/application-programming-interface) to generate your keys and plug them into code where necessary. **Please do not publicly display your API Key, store in a different object/class and do not list it in your pull request!** 

The API code will look like this:

```kotlin
val url = "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod/?api_key=$API_KEY"
```

Where API_KEY is the variable used to parse the API Key.
